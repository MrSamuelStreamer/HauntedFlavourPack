# HauntedFlavourPack
This is a secret, STAY AWAY

The PLACEHOLDER Flavour Pack is a suplementary mod to the PLACEHOLDER mod pack and scenario. The concept is simple, pay attention! Did that table move? Is that person feeling unwell for suspicious reasons? Is the new guy a witch, or maybe a metalhorror? Is there a brewing consipiracy deep in the bowels of the colony and you have to unconver it?

Main aim:

PAY ATTENTION. No more speed 5 through quiet times. No more walking away as people build base. Your colonists have the same potential to cause trouble as raiders, with conspiracies, hauntings, paranoia, division, schisms, and more. Quietly, plots will brew, possessions will occur, strange hauntings will happen, and its up to you to observe and, when the time is right, resolve the matter.
